# OOP Practice

This repository contains various object-oriented programming (OOP) practice codes written in Java. These programs are part of my personal learning journey as I explore and strengthen my understanding of OOP concepts such as:

- Classes and Objects
- Inheritance
- Polymorphism
- Abstraction
- Encapsulation
- and more...

Feel free to browse through the code. Feedback and suggestions are always welcome!

**Note:** These programs are written for practice and educational purposes.
